Description: The package 'ozcovid' contains three functions and a dataset: a function entitled `launch_app` which launches the shiny application 'Coronavirus In Australia' - the application allows the user to interact with (by selecting their state/territory or date of choice) and investigate Australia's coronavirus data. The dataset 'oz_covid_data' allows the user work with the data underlying the shiny app. The functions 'stateSelectInput' and 'vicEventRenderText' contain refactored code from the ui and server components of the Shiny application.
